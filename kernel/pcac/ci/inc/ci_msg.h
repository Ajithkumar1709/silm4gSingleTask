 * provide the HLR, SGSN and VLR with which the recipient MS is associated with the information
 * that there is a message in the originating SC waiting to be delivered to the MS. The service
 * element is only used in case of previous unsuccessful delivery attempt(s) due to temporarily
 * absent mobile or MS memory capacity exceeded."
 * "There are three levels of "Message Waiting" indication: The first level is to set the
 * Protocol Identifier to "Return Call message". The second level uses the Data Coding Scheme
 * TP_DCS (see 3GPP TS 23.038) to indicate the type of message waiting and whether there are
 * some messages or no messages. The third level provides the maximum detail level for analysis by
 * the mobile and is extracted from TP_UDH; this information shall be stored by the ME in the
 * Message Waiting Indication Status (EF_MWIS file) on the SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011) or
 * USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102) when present or otherwise should be stored in the ME." \n
 * \n
 * Message waiting status information can be provided in the TC_DCS or TC_UDH of
 * SMS_DELIVER, SMS_SUBMIT_REPORT, and SMS_STATUS_REPORT messages, as
 * specified in TS 23.040 (section 9.2.3.24.2 Special SMS Message Indication) and
 * TS 23.038 (section 4. SMS Data Coding Scheme). Where disagreement occurs, TP_UDH
 * overrides the TP_DCS. \n
 * \n
 * The indicationActive field provides the indication sense (how it is presented to the user)
 * for the message waiting status on systems connected to the GSM/UMTS PLMN. It is specified
 * only by TP_DCS.
 * The msgCount field is specified only through TP_UDH. When only TP_DCS is provided, the
 * msgCount is set to zero (0). (Currently it is always set to zero because the protocol stack
 * doesn't support the third level of MWI.) */

 * The memCapExceeded and usedRecords parameters are specified in
