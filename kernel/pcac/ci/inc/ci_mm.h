 * Before ECC call start, SSG AP just use it to query avaiable RAT value for ECC call;
 * and if ECC call failed, SSG AP want to use it to change another RAT value
 * For example: 
 * a> if AP sends ECC start with 0xFF RAT, then CP will response with
 * available RAT(LTE) and RAT_Status(1), 
 * b> then, first of all, AP will try make ECC call using IMS over LTE;
 * c> If failed, the AP will send ECC set(0x04 and RAT(LTE)), then CP has to 
 * send next available ECC rat and response (ex. act = 3G and actStatus = 1)
