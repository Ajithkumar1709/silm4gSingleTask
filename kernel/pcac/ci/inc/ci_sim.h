/* Description of the SIM behavior from the CCI point of view; use of
 * CiSimStatus & CiSimPinState
 *
 * After the SIM card is inserted, the protocol stack needs to perform an
 * initialization phase to obtain and validate all the required
 * information about the SIM card.
 * If PIN1 is enabled, then the protocol stack would need to perform PIN
 * validation before the initialization; the PIN must be obtained from the
 * application, so the protocol stack sends a 'PIN required' notification and
 * waits for the response.
 * If PIN1 is not required then the initialization is started immediately.
 * SIM can be accessed only after the successful completion of the initialization phase;
 * (appropriate notification (ex: SIM OK) is sent to the upper layers.
 * At any time, an indication of SIM error would mean that SIM is invalid and
 * SIM related functionality cannot be used; exception is the error indicating
 * that SIM was rejected by the network, in which case access to the phone book
 * should still be possible.
 * CCI sends the' CiSimPrimDeviceInd/CiSimPrimCardInd' notification each time a change
 * occurs in the SIM status as well as the PIN state.
 * Based on the above behavior design, the following diagram shows the SIM status & PIN
 * state transitions at the CCI level:
 *
 * 1)	at startup
 *
 *    status = not ready
 *    pinState = removed
 *
 * 2)	CCI received 'SIM card inserted' indication from protocol stack; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = inserted
 *    pinState = waitInit
 *
 * 3)	CCI received 'PIN required' indication from protocol stack; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = inserted
 *    pinState = pin1Required/unblockPin1Required/others
 *
 * 4)	APP sends the PIN to CCI; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = inserted
 *    pinState = waitInit
 *
 * 5)	CCI received 'SIM is OK' (initialization completed & SIM ready to be accessed)
 *    indication from protocol stack; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = ready
 *    pinState = ready
 *
 * 6)	in the ready state, if CCI receives 'SIM rejected by the network' indication from
 *    protocol stack; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = ready
 *    pinState = rejectedByNetwork
 *
 * 7)	at any other time, if CCI receives 'SIM is NOT OK' indication from protocol stack; CCI sends:
 *
 *    status = not ready
 *    pinState = initError, mepError, removed, etc.
